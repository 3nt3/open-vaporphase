# Open Vaporphase

# Hardware

## Requirements

- Active cooling
- Ventilation
- Lid switch
- Buzzer to play the Forelle song like a samsung washing machine (required to be configurable to also imitate a rice cooker)

## Safety

We try to follow relevant EU legislature Directive 2006/42/EC (Machinery Directive) as a source of best practices.

### Hazards

- Thermal: High-temperature fluids and surfaces
- Chemical: Vapor phase fluids (PFPE, Galden, etc.)
- Electrical

### Ideas

- Heater control fails OFF
- Loss of sensor input disables heating
- Prevention of runoff heating when liquid is missing
- Lid-open condition prevents heating
- Manual emergency stop immediately removes power
